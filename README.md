# ðŸ’» Hi, my name is Eric Errickson.

----

### I am a software engineer in San Francisco, California, U.S. 

  ...well, at least I was a working software engineer before the whole world changed due to the pandemic. The greatest advantage I had in biddding jobs was my location; not only US, but San Francisco. On Mar 17, 2020, that advantage evaporated when we all became de facto remote workers.

So, we adapt. **"Penetration Testing with Kali Linux"** (*PEN-200*) is the foundational course at Offensive Security. I am beginning work on my [**"Offensive Security Certified Professional"** ](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) (*OSCP*) certification. I created this GitHub to document that process both to reinforce my own learning, but possibly as an aid to otherss on the same jorney in the future.
